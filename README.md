# Summary

> Thursday is the most popular day to take a bike ride.
> It would be a good idea for clients to start the bikeshare business in a different city because whether people are biking to get to work or just doing it for fun there are lots of users, as well as housed at high traffic locations where they are more likely to be checked out and returned to.
